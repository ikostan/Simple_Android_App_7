# Simple Android App 7

## Problem â€“ 6/49 Number Picker

### Write an application that would generate four sets of 6/49 numbers for the user to choose from.
	
### Each set should have 6 numbers ranging from 1 to 49 (no duplicates).

### When the app starts	When the Generate Number is clicked	When certain numbers are selected, and Pick button was clicked
 	 	 

## Some guidance
### 1.	You can create a separate Java class with a method that generates the random numbers. This method can then be used in your MainActivity each time you need a series of numbers.
### 2.	Android programming is basically Java coding with extra GUI libraries. The fundamentals are still the same. Therefore, you can actually create an array of CheckBox. Each element points to a specific CheckBox. This would then allow you to reference the different checkboxes via index and loop.
### 3.	Sometimes, you will find similarities in features and/or concept. Example: JLabel and TextView

## Example Output (you can re-design to make it more appealing)
